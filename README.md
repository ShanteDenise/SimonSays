SimonSays Project

Overview
------

For project #1, I created my version of the famous Simon Says game.

Instructions
-------
When Simon says is switched to on and the start button is pressed, Simon will provide a sequence.
The player is expected to have an exact match to Simon's sequence. At each level simon's sequence will increase by one. When the player reachs level 20 the player will win the game and the game will start over, automatically. If the user's sequence is not equal to simons sequence at any time, an alert will appear providing the users score (score = level) and the game will start over.
